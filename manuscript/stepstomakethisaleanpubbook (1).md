Dear readers,

I'm happy to announce that the final version of The Node Beginner Book is now available on Leanpub.

As always, this update is free of charge for existing readers.

The main changes start at page 48 with chapter "Handling file uploads".

Furthermore, the code samples have been improved in that they now fit the page width in every case.
The table of contents is now more detailed, allowing you to directly jump to every section of interest.

Please email me at manuel@kiessling.net for feedback, corrections, ideas, or anything else.

PS: "Final version" means that the content is now complete - corrections or updates that are neccessary to reflect changes in Node.js will be released in the future.

Regards,

Manuel Kiessling
